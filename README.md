# DevOps Bootcamp
This is the code repository for [DevOps Bootcamp](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/devops-bootcamp?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787285965), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
DevOps Bootcamp delivers practical learning modules in manageable chunks. Each chunk is delivered in a day, and each day is a productive one. Each day builds your competency in DevOps. You will be able to take the task you learn every day and apply it to cultivate the DevOps culture.

Each chapter presents core concepts and key takeaways about a topic in DevOps and provides a series of hands-on exercises. You will not only learn the importance of basic concepts or practices of DevOps but also how to use different tools to automate application lifecycle management.

We will start off by building the foundation of the DevOps concepts. On day two, we will perform Continuous Integration using Jenkins and VSTS both by configuring Maven-based JEE Web Application​. We will also integrate Jenkins and Sonar qube for Static Code Analysis. Further, on day three, we will focus on Docker containers where we will install and configure Docker and also create a Tomcat Container to deploy our Java based web application. On day four, we will create and configure the environment for application deployment in AWS and Microsoft Azure Cloud for which we will use Infrastructure as a Service and Open Source Configuration Management tool Chef. For day five, our focus would be on Continuous Delivery. We will automate application deployment in Docker container using Jenkins Plugin, AWS EC2 using Script, AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Jenkins Plugin, Microsoft Azure VM using script, and Microsoft Azure App Services Using Jenkins. We will also configure Continuous Delivery using VSTS. We will then learn the concept of Automated Testing on day six using Apache JMeter and URL-based tests in VSTS. Further, on day seven, we will explore various ways to automate application lifecycle management using orchestration. We will see how Pipeline can be created in Jenkins and VSTS, so the moment Continuous​ Integration is completed successfully, Continuous Delivery will start and application will be deployed. On the final day, our focus would be on Security access to Jenkins and Monitoring of CI resources, and cloud-based resources in AWS and Microsoft Azure Platform as a Service.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Suite">
<test name="Test">
<classes>
<class name="example.PetClinicTest"/>
</classes>
</test><!-- Test -->
</suite><!-- Suite -->
```

This book assumes that you are familiar with at least the Java programming language.
Knowledge of core Java and JEE is essential if you want to gain better insights from this
book. Having a strong understanding of the deployment of a web application in application
servers such as Tomcat will help you to understand the flow quickly. However, we have
quickly provided an overview of it. As the application development life cycle will cover a
lot of tools in general, it is essential to have some knowledge of code repositories, as well as
IDE tools such as Eclipse, and build tools such as Ant and Maven.
Knowledge of code analysis tools will make your job easier in configuration and
integration; however, it is not vital to perform the exercises given in the book. Most of the
configuration steps are mentioned clearly, step by step, and by providing screenshots
for clear visualization.
You will be walked through the steps required to get familiar with Jenkins, VSTS, Microsoft
Azure Web Apps, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. For Microsoft Azure, you can use a 1-month
trial access. VSTS also comes with a trial account with some restrictions. AWS also has 1-
year trial period with specific limitations.
